Inscribe is a fast and elegant tool for creating USB drives from ISO images on Linux. It offers a clean interface, clear progress indicators, and advanced controls for seasoned users. Follow these steps to start using Inscribe.

## üõ† System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Linux (Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, and other distributions)
- **Disk Space**: At least 200 MB free space for installation.
- **USB Drive**: A USB drive with at least 8 GB of storage.
- **Internet Connection**: Required for downloading the application.

## üìÇ Installation

1. **Visit the Releases Page**  
   Go to the Inscribe [Releases page](https://github.com/SagarKumar96/Inscribe/releases).

2. **Download the Latest Version**  
   Look for the latest version of Inscribe. Click on the appropriate file for your system. For most Linux users, this will be an AppImage file. 

3. **Save the File**  
   Choose a location on your computer where you want to save the downloaded file, then click 'Save'.

4. **Make it Executable**  
   Once the download is complete, open your file manager. Right-click the downloaded AppImage file, select "Properties," then navigate to the "Permissions" tab. Check the box that says "Allow executing file as program."

5. **Run Inscribe**  
   Double-click the AppImage file to start Inscribe. You can also run it from the terminal by navigating to the folder where you saved the file and typing `./Inscribe-x.y.z-x86_64.AppImage`, replacing `x.y.z` with the version number.

## üìñ Using Inscribe

Once Inscribe is running, you will see a straightforward user interface. Here‚Äôs a quick overview of how to create a bootable USB drive:

1. **Select ISO File**  
   Click on the "Select Image" button. Browse your files and choose the ISO file you want to write to the USB drive.

2. **Insert USB Drive**  
   Ensure your USB drive is plugged in. Inscribe should automatically detect it. If it doesn‚Äôt, refresh the device list.

3. **Choose Target USB Drive**  
   From the list of available drives, select your USB drive. Be careful to pick the right one, as this tool will erase any data on the drive.

4. **Start Imaging**  
   Click on the "Flash!" button. Inscribe will start writing the image to the USB drive. You can monitor the progress in the status bar.

5. **Finish Up**  
   Once the process is complete, you will receive a notification. Eject your USB drive safely before removing it.

## üîí Verifying Downloads

To ensure your download is safe, verify the checksum of the downloaded file. You can do this by following these steps:

1. **Get the Checksum**  
   On the Releases page, next to the download link, you will find a corresponding checksum file (usually in SHA256 format).

2. **Open Terminal**  
   Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the AppImage and run the following command:  
   ```
   sha256sum Inscribe-x.y.z-x86_64.AppImage
   ```
   Replace `Inscribe-x.y.z-x86_64.AppImage` with the actual file name.

3. **Compare Checksum**  
   Compare the output with the checksum from the Releases page. If they match, your file is safe to run.
